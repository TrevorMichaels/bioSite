                    <p>My wife and I had a five year plan, we wanted to get our college degrees, I was going to become a police officer, we wanted to gain a steady income for our children and provide them with a car and house. We accomplished all of these goals in four years.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Can you give a synopsis of your work accomplishments and promotions?
                    <p>I started by spending a year and a half on patrol, I then went undercover for street-level narcotics for 2 years, promoted to corporal in field training, became a detective for one year in major crimes, transferred over to homicide for 5 years, where I spearheaded a major case known as the Esperanza fires.</p>
                    <p>After that major case, I got recruited by the District Attorney’s Office, where I went to work for the Burea of Investigations in 2007 as a Senior Investigator, there I was cross-sworn as a homeland security agent and worked out of DEA’s office in close relation with the FBI, during that time I finished the first and, still to this day, only RICO case in riverside county.</p>
                    <p>After all that, I was promoted to supervisor in the organized crime unit, joined the SWAT team, became team leader, then commander, and now am the assistant chief of the SWAT team. In the meantime, I was promoted to commander of special operations and special prosecutions, and from there, I was promoted to Assistant Chief. </p>
                    <p>I am now in charge of the special and western operations of the riverside county and am in charge of dignitary protection, which I formed myself with riverside never having dignitary protection before.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    What did your family life look like while you were promoting at work?
                    <p>We first started with trying to raise our first born and then moved on to have our second son 6 years later and our daughter 5 years after that. Because of work I was a little absent from home in the earlier years, while your Mom took care of you all mostly but have been much more involved in the later years. I also got my master’s degree in human resource management and leadership and moved us back to Orange County, where I grew up as a child.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    What made you get into sailing and the ocean as hobbies?
                    <p>I got into sailing because of my love for the ocean, when I was a child we would take the bus to Larwin Square and spend the day at the beach and come back every day during the summer, we would surf, bodyboard, snorkel, you name it.</p>
                    <p>I always had the interest in sailing but no time and money, now in my later years, I’ve become the member of two yacht clubs the American Legion and The Oasis yacht club, and I love bad weather and racing in sailing because of the challenges they present.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    What made you want to scuba dive?
                    <p>I got into diving with the same passion for the beach, my friend named Matt Burden  was the leader of the sheriff's dive team and helped set me up through dive class with those connections and then I started diving with Devin, my oldest son, and now with you, my second son. I love mastering the ability to swim in the ocean and control your environment and communicate with the people around you while underwater</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    What made you interested in restoring motorcycles and Tractors?
                    <p>I grew up every summer going to the farm in Central California with my mother and always had a fond memory of my time with the animals and tractors there, I learned to drive stick on a tractor, which I remember as a Ford 4000. I would buy tractors in auctions with my mom and fix then sell them for profit. When I found an old Ford 4000 tractor by chance, I bought it, I restored it and since then have fallen in love with the building of the tractors, I now own two.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    And the passion behind restoring motorcycles is similar to the reasons for wanting to work on tractors I’d imagine?
                    <p>Absolutely, I love motorcycles because of my love of learning how to work on things and tinker. Tractors are less accessible, and motorcycles allow for more projects and more tinker time. Fixing something broken is therapeutic for me and helps with my PTSD and brain trauma (TBI) from my career. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    What are your future goals in your later years?
                    <p>I want to turn my engineering passion as I’ve gotten older into building a business, I’ve secured a patent for a device I’m proud of and hope to turn that into a passive income and something great for my family and generations to come.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Where have you traveled and where do you want to travel?
                    <p>I have travelled to Central America, Canada, and Mexico but I have the desire to sail around the world and see so much more. I really want to sail the Atlantic then the Panama Canal, and from there, the rest of the world. I would also love to see the Azores and would love to see many parts of Asia.</p>
